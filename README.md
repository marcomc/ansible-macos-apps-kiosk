# Ansible macOS apps kiosk

Collection of macOS apps to be installed via `ansible-macos-apps-intall` role

This collection can include any macOS app, but is generally intended to provide a mean of automation for the installation of those applications that are not available as a Homebrew Cask or not available on Mac App Store.
